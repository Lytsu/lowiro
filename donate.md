# Donate

If you find my work valuable, and would like to encourage the development of the site, you can do it by donating.

## Story

First of all, welcome to this donation page. However, I'm sorry to say that this page will not be available in Simplified Chinese, although the overall language used on the site is Simplified Chinese.

Lowlight is a website that provides some rhythm games downloading. Lowlight started out as *[lowi.ro](https://lowi.ro)* and got the name it has today after the site got more domains like *[nhe.lv](https://nhe.lv)* and *[lowlight.pages.dev](https://lowlight.pages.dev)*. 

So what does "Lowlight" mean? I expressed it as "a faint light". As a "light", it should be more of an emanation of its own light, and "light" does not ask others for donations.

Frankly speaking, I am not willing to charge anyone even for a donation. I think that in the absence of actual content, donations are actually a kind of begging in disguise. Starting a download site is not a big deal, especially when my predecessor, *[Konmai Academy](https://616.sb)*, shines on my achievements.

If you insist on donating, I suggest you first donate to the community-driven rhythm games (like *Malody*) offered on this site, and then consider donating to this site.
